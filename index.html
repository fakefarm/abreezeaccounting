I'm a successful small business owner who has a special place in my heart for the entrepreneur and who has been around the block enough times to know what his/her needs and challenges are.  I have 30 years experience in accounting/bookkeeping (yikes) and more than 15 years of QuickBooks experience and am a QuickBooks ProAdvisor (although not yet certified, but am working on it)</p><p>I have learned that although most small business owners face similar challenges, each one has different accounting needs as every business is unique.  From every client I learn something new and always come across something they need that I have never seen before.  It's here where I believe I stand out from the rest.  When facing the uncharted waters I know there is always a way to navigate them - I just have to figure out how.  And I do that.</p><h3>My goals with every client are:</h3><p>1)  To make the accounting process "Abreeze" for the small business owner by either taking the drudgery away from them or giving them the proper training to make sure they're able to be as efficient and accurate as possible in their daily tasks.  The owner needs to spend time managing the business and making money.  They can't do that when they're bogged down in frustrating accounting tasks that they don't enjoy and which are not their area of expertise.</p><p>2)  To provide them at year-end with a clean set of books with adequate reports and details to present to their tax preparer.  This not only makes the preparer happy but results in a lower bill because they have less work to do.  And, not incidentally, having the proper backup and details will help protect the client in case of an audit.</p></div></section></body><script src="scripts/nav_overlay-747321c6.js"></script><script type="text/javascript">(function(i,s,o,g,r,a,m){i['GoogleAnalyticsObject']=r;i[r]=i[r]||function(){
